Crucible is the capital island of [the Sunsea](Sunsea.md), being a circular island with layers of biomes surrounding a vast, snowy tundra. In the center of this tundra lies its only settlement, also named Crucible. 

## The Whitening 
This landscape used to be a blazing desert. When [Raumus](../Personae/Raumus.md) returned from his [Journey for the Sun](../Events/Journey-for-the-Sun.md) and planted [the Orange Mesquite](Orange-Mesquite.md), however, snow began falling around it, and formed what was long known as [the White Moor](White-Moor.md). After Raumus died and was buried in [the Tufan Tombs](Tufan-Tombs.md), the snowfall expanded to all of Crucible, which is today entirely covered in snow. 

## Crucian Heliolatry 
The type of sun worship practiced by Crucians combined with their blood and proximity to Crucible grants them immense magical power. Reasons for this are unclear. 

**Effects of Crucian Heliolatry:** 
- Energizes clarity, vitality, and will 
- Strengthens ego, confidence, and direction 
- Aligns with diurnal rhythm and conscious identity 
- Risks pride, burnout, or control fixation 
- Connection with life, gold, order, and creation

Due to the scarcity of resources in Crucible and the scarcity of magic in other parts of Sunsea, trade of magical services has always been the Crucian community's only means of survival.
