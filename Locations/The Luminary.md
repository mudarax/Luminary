The Luminary or "Library of Light" is the repository where all data about [Dreimos.md](Dreimos.md) is stored. <br> 
Any [Drifter](Drifter.md) can submit changes to the Luminary, but only a [Luminarian](Luminarian.md) can enact said changes. <br> 
It consists of so-called "[nodes](Nodes.md)" or files that describe locations, characters, events, items, etc.. <br> 
Normally when visiting Dreimos, one will join [the Drift](The Drift.md) or interact with a specific node. <br> 
However, the Luminary is always a safe bet, as it is the core or nexus of Dreimos -- not only for Drifters.
