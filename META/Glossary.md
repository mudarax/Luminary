**Dream incubation** <br> 
Techniques used to influence the content of dreams. Quietly focus your intention on the desired theme while falling asleep, and keep a dream journal. See ‚Å†[Resources](Resources.md). 
<br><br>

**Dreimos** <br> 
Collective, collaborative dreamscape, continually shaped through waking-life discussion and explored through dream incubation. 
<br><br>

**The Drift** <br>
Our caravan of nomads who design Dreimos in the daytime and inhabit it by nightfall. You can roam freely, or travel with the group. 
<br><br> 

**Drifters** <br>
Members of the Drift and creators of Dreimos. When we are awake, our Dreimos personae are asleep. Different inhabitants take on different attitudes toward us; some don't know about the Drift at all. 
<br><br> 

**The Luminary** <br>
The "library of light" is a repository where all data about Dreimos is stored. Drifters make changes to the Luminary by submitting them to a @Luminarian.
