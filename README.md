## Glossary 

- **Dream incubation** — Techniques used to influence the content of dreams. In short: Quietly focus your intention on the desired theme while falling asleep, and keep a dream journal. It's simple in essence, but takes patience. 

- **[Dreimos](Dreimos.md)** — Collective, collaborative dreamscape, continually shaped through waking-life discussion and explored through dream incubation. 

- **The Luminary** — The "Library of Light" is the database where all information about [Dreimos](Dreimos.md) is stored. It consists of so-called "nodes" or files that describe locations, personae, events, items and more. [Luminarians](Luminarian.md) serve as its stewards. 

- **[The Drift](Drift.md)** — Our caravan of nomads who design Dreimos in the daytime and inhabit it by nightfall. You can roam freely, or travel with the group. 

- **[Drifters](Drifter.md)** — Members of the Drift and creators of Dreimos. When we are awake, our Dreimos personae are asleep. Different inhabitants take on different attitudes toward us; some don't know about the Drift at all. Any [Drifter](Drifter.md) can submit changes to the Luminary, but only a [Luminarian](Luminarian.md) can enact said changes.
