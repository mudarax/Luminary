The Luminary or "Library of Light" is the database where all information about [Dreimos.md](Dreimos.md) is stored. <br> 
Any [Drifter](Drifter.md) can submit changes to the Luminary, but only a [Luminarian](Luminarian.md) can enact said changes. <br> 
It consists of so-called "[nodes](Nodes.md)" or files that describe locations, characters, events, items, etc.. <br> 
Interact with the Luminary and couple your findings with [dream incubation techniques](META/Glossary.md), you learn to interact with Dreimos.
