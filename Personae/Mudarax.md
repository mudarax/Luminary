## Waking relevance 
MUDARAX attests my commitment to the artist's path. I am a musician and a diplomat between light and dark. <br> 
The symbols represent enlightenment, sunlight & sacredness, death & transformative chaos, and grounding & ancestral connection. <br>
I am mortally undead, honest in secrecy, the creation that creates.
