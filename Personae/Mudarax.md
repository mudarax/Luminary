## waking relevance 
MUDARAX attests my commitment to the artist's path. I am a musician and a diplomat between light and dark. <br> 
The symbols represent enlightenment, sunlight & sacredness, death & transformative chaos, and grounding & ancestral connection. 
I am mortally deathless, honest in secrecy, creator & creation.
