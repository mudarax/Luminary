# MUDARAX 

## Appearance 
Silver skeleton with a golden halo and bronze antlers. Clothed in rags. [Sigil](../META/Images/mudarax-sigil.png). <br>

## Links  
- First visitation to [Dreimos](../Locations/Dreimos.md) was when I emerged from [Tufan Tombs](Locations/Tufan-Tombs.md). 

## Waking relevance 
MUDARAX attests my commitment to the artist's path. I am a musician and a diplomat between light and dark. <br> 
The symbols represent death & transformative chaos, grounding & ancestral connection, and enlightenment, sunlight & sacredness. <br>
I am mortally undead, honest in secrecy. The creation that creates.
