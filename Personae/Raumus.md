**Raumus, Sorcerer of Sunlight and Otherwise Maize** was born in [Crucible](../Locations/Crucible.md), initially nameless, and soon found himself rejecting their sun worship. 
He left Crucible to chase the sun, and discover whether its true color could be known. 
Upon returning, he was wearing a black blindfold, had brought with him a shit-ton of oranges. His attitude toward Crucible had changed. 
Raumus soon went to plant [the Orange Mesquite] (Orange-Mesquite.md), around which snow would soon fall to form [the White Moor] (../Locations/White-Moor.md). 
Later, Raumus would be killed by [a snow lion named Nunku] (Nunku.md) and buried in [the Tufan Tombs](../Locations/Tufan-Tombs.md).
